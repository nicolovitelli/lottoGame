# LottoGame

- Project based on the Italian Game "Lotto"
- Rules at: https://www.sisal.it/lotto/come-si-gioca

## Info

How to start the program:
- Launch lotto_lottery.py by writing "python lotto_lottery.py (amount of tickets)". A maximum of 5 tickets is allowed.
- For each ticket, insert its type (1 to 5, the program will display every available type)
- For each ticket, insert the amount of numbers to generate (up to 10 numbers)
- For each ticket, insert the City (must insert a valid City with this format: "Roma", "roma" or "ROMA". Others format are not accepted)
Once you inserted correctly all tickets, the program shows your tickets with the numbers generated (ASCII Table to be implemented)
